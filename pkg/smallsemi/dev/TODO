TESTING
#######

- test IdSmallSemigroup for all semigroups. AD

- test EquivalenceSmallSemigroup. AD

- check that functions for Magmas and elements of Magmas work like we expect
  them to. AD + JDM

TODO
####

- fix 'IsZeroGroup' conflict with MONOID.

- add synonyms 'EnumeratorSmallSemigroup', 'NrOfSmallSemigroups'

- test under Windows, provide Windows version, or at least document better AD

TODO before PhD submission
##########################

- put IsCliffordSemigroup in EQUIVALENT as completely regular + inverse
  and delete it from info files

- improve descriptions in GAP code files AD

- install immediate methods for properties, e.g. IsNilpotent => Is1Idempotent

- change 'MinimalGeneratingSet' to use precomputed information of the form
  'Is<X>GeneratedSemigroup' and change the latter function not to use the
  former. AD

- add AutomorphismGroup method to smallsemi (maybe similar to
   IsSelfDualSemigroup using OnSets rather than transaction)

- Improve IdSmallSemigroup, EquivalenceSmallSemigroup AD

TODO later
##########

- change behaviour of IsSemigroupWith(out)ClosedIdempotents, not storing
  both properties, trigger immediate method for IsOrthodoxSemigroup. AD

- speed up creation if semigroups are created in the order they appear in the library

- use 'EnumeratorOfSmallSemigroupsByIds' to make 'DiagonalOfMultiplicationTable'
  work as precomputed data. AD

- Is3NilpotentSemigroup should be stored for n=1 to 7
OBSOLETE AFTER DUE TO NilpotencyRank. AD

- install methods for all attributes and properties in enums.g* that 
return false or fail

- add IsLeftZeroSemigroup to precomputed data or handle differently

- allow enumerators, iterators, all semigroups, to accept a list of semigroups as 
first argument

- make a list of small semigroups an admissible input for every thing in enums.g*

- need a method for IsomorphismPermGroup of a small semigroup with 
IsGroupAsSemigroup

- there should be an info display thing so that if the info level is 2 say it 
displays what gap is doing. I'm thinking of when I do s:=RandomSmallSemigroup(6), 
then DisplaySmallSemigroup(s). There is a very long delay at this point.  AD

- DisplaySmallSemigroup should probably say: Properties satisfied by s: IsBlah, 
IsXY etc... rather than what it does currently. JDM

- extend the recognition function to include known property information. JDM
 (function that finds the known properties using StoredSmallSemiInfo)

- licensing issues JDM + AD

- IsJTrivial, IsAperiodic, IsBlockGroup, IsLUnipotent, IsRUnipotent, etc

- add IsomorphismSmallSemigroup and AntiIsomorphismSmallSemigroup as attributes for 
IsSemigroup

- change Stabilizer and Orbit calculation involving 'action','rowaction' or
  'transaction' to use literals and 'OnSet' as action 

- restructure the data according minimal generating set, automorphism group, 
green's relations etc...

- congruences, subsemigroups, more?

- include monoids data...

- commutative semigroups of higher orders

- Sloan's sequences

- special method for IsCommutativeSemigroup, IsCommutative should call this

- use MinimalGeneratingSet in special methods for property testing

- change InstallOtherMethod to InstallMethod where possible

- IsMultSemigroupOfNearRing does it test for isomorphism or equivalence? Likewise 
IsFullTransformationSemigroupCopy and IsSingularSemigroupCopy?

DONE
####

- change affiliation. AD

- fix bug in 'IsDoneIterator' JDM

- adjust packing script to use 'Revision' entry instead of time stamps. JDM

- add citation advice (text, bibtex) on webpage JDM

- check definition for Brandt semigroup in introduction of properties section
  of the manual; is 0-simple defined?; add to DisplaySmall...

- add algorithm to compute number of 3-nilpotent semigroups. AD 

- IsSelfDualSemigroup for 8 (store in a sensible way, avoid long loading) AD  

- using GAPDoc package to test manual examples (see smallsemi.xml) AD + JDM

- add 'IsMonogenicSemigroup' to precomputed properties, link with
  'Is1GeneratedSemigroup'. AD

- move 'EquivalenceSmallSemigroup' for semigroups from the library from
  creation to special case of the function with that name. AD

- fix clashes with MONOID package

- allow enumerators for size 8 on 64-bit systems JDM
  (e.g. use GAPInfo.BytesPerVariable)

- NC version for RecoverMultiplicationTable AD

- correct IsSimpleSemigroup data in data files AD

- add new ZeroGroup example to properties.tst AD

- Change IsOrthodox and IsNotOrthodox to IsSemigroupWithClosedIdempotents AD

- IsOrthodoxSemigroup requires a method and maybe a SMALLSEMI_EQUIV.

- improve performance for 'AllSmallSemigroups(n,IsOrthodox,true);' AD & JDM

- check IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup AD

- rename MinimalGeneratorsOfSemigroup to MinimalGeneratingSet AD

- remove MinimalGeneratingSets from data files AD

- UpToIsomorphism ought to accept a single semigroup as an argument (not only a list containing a single semigroup). AD

- Add IsSemigroupWithZero method

- shouldn't NilpotencyRank be set after IsNilpotentSemigroup has been run? 
NO, AS THE LATTER CAN BE DECIDED WITHOUT COMPUTING THE RANK. AD
also shouldn't the filter 
for NilpotencyRank just be IsSmallSemigroup and then IsNilpotentSemigroup 
be the first test performed?
CHANGED. AD

- fix IsRightZeroSemigroup AD + JDM

- put copyright in all files, write script for size 8 AD + JDMs

- IteratorOfSmallSemigroups JDM (in addition to EnumeratorOfSmallSemigroup, maybe only allow EnumeratorOfSmallSemigroup for non-user defined functions)s

- IsMonogenic, IsNilpotentSemigroup, NilpotencyRank, IsFullTransformationSemigroup, 

- fix known properties of ... function JDM (AD any suggestions?)

- recompute properties in smallsemi: IsCompletelyRegularSemigroup, IsRegularSemigroup, IsCliffordSemigroup, IsInverseSemigroup, IsZeroGroup, IsRectangularBand, IsSimpleSemigroup, IsSemiBand, IsGroupAsSemigroup, IsNotOrthodoxSemigroup JDM (double check it is done already?)

- documentation for all functions JDM

- introduction for documentation AD

- make a compliant webpage JDM

- test files (and debugging) JDM, AD

- IsSemiBand: precompute data, use IsBand (how is that done? AD) JDMs

- decide how to handle info messages in test files

- change name IsFullTransformationSemigroup to IsFullTransformationSemigroupCopy 
- change IsSingularSemigroup to IsSingularSemigroupCopy

- adjust IsMultSemigroupOfNearRing using STORED_INFO

- change 'order' to 'size' AD

- include 3-nilpotent semigroups of order 8 AD

- StoredSmallSemiInfo(n) JDM.

- more advanced property testing (AllSmallSemigroups & EnumeratorAllSmallSemigroups, OneSmallSemigroup, RandomSmallSemigroup) JDM

- recognition function AD

- put list of diagonals, and positions in data into info.g files AD

- random things  AD

-small generating sets

- update GPL AD.

THINGS THAT DID NOT WORK
########################

- extend examples with lattice computation. AD
