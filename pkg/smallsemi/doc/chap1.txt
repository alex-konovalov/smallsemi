  
  [1X1 Introduction[0X
  
  This manual describes the [5XSmallsemi[0m package (Version 0.6.2) for [5XGAP[0m.
  
  The  [5XSmallsemi[0m  package  is  a  data library of semigroups of small size. It
  provides  all  semigroups  with  at  most  8  elements  as  well  as various
  information about these objects. The reason that semigroups of higher orders
  are  not  included  is  the  huge  number  of  such  objects. The numbers of
  semigroups  of  sizes  1  to  9  are given in the table below. The number of
  semigroups of size 10 is not known at the time of writing.

  The  initial  idea  for  [5XSmallsemi[0m  was  developed  out  of  the wish for an
  extensive  number  of  examples of semigroups of moderate size. This lead to
  the idea of an electronical database. As an existing example the [5XSmallGroups
  Library[0m  [BEO02]  was  an  inspiration  on  how  such  a  project  could  be
  established.  Unfortunately  the number of semigroups is so much bigger, and
  most  of  them  bare  so  little structure, that new techniques to store and
  handle  the semigroups had to be developed. Of course, the first step was to
  actually construct all the semigroups.
  
  In  the  remainder  of  the  introduction  we explain what you need to do to
  install and optimize [5XSmallsemi[0m; see Subsections [14X1.1[0m and [14X1.2[0m.
  
  In  Chapter  [14X2[0m we explain how the semigroups where obtained, what exactly is
  stored and how, and which additional properties have been precomputed.
  
  The  the  types  of  use  [5XSmallsemi[0m  is intended for and its limitations are
  described  in Chapter [14X3[0m. The extensive examples can be used as a quick-start
  guide  and  as something to come back to after reading the technical details
  about available functionality in the subsequent sections.
  
  Chapter [14X4[0m has all the information about available functions.
  
  
  [1X1.1 Requirements[0X
  
  This  software is written for [5XGAP[0m 4. It requires an existing installation of
  [5XGAP[0m in version 4.4.12 or higher.
  
  It  is  recommended  but not necessary to have the [5XGAP[0m 4 packages [5XMONOID[0m and
  [5Xsgpviz[0m  installed as well. [5XMONOID[0m provides a wide range of functionality for
  working  with semigroups which is not available in the [5XGAP[0m core system while
  [5Xsgpviz[0m  is  recommended  for  its  ability  to  graphically  represent small
  semigroups.
  
  
  [1X1.1-1 Operating System[0X
  
  The  current  version  of  [5XSmallsemi[0m was created for use under Unix. It will
  also   work   under   Windows  but  only  if  all  files  in  the  directory
  [11Xsmallsemi/data[0m   and   all  of  its  subdirectories  are  uncompressed.  See
  Subsection  [14X1.1-3[0m  for  additional  comments on working with [5XSmallsemi[0m under
  Windows.
  
  
  [1X1.1-2 RAM[0X
  
  Working  with  [5XSmallsemi[0m  can  be  memory expensive. We recommend to have at
  least 1 GB of RAM available. With less than 512 MB not all the semigroups of
  size 8 can be accessed.
  
  You should be able to use the semigroups of orders 1 through 7 having 128 MB
  of  RAM  only.  If  you  have  a system with little memory or want to use as
  little  memory as possible for the [5XGAP[0m process try using [2XUnloadSmallsemiData[0m
  ([14X4.1-9[0m)  to free memory after every access to the library. This is likely to
  slow down computations though.
  
  For  further  infomation  on  how  [5XGAP[0m  uses memory see [14X1.2-4[0m or [14X'Reference:
  Command Line Options'[0m.
  
  
  [1X1.1-3 Disk Space[0X
  
  As  the  data  in  the  library  is  compressed, 30 MB of disk space will be
  sufficient to install [5XSmallsemi[0m under Unix. To use the library under Windows
  the data has to be uncompressed and will then occupy approx. 1.6 GB.
  
  All  data  files  are  compressed  using [11Xgzip[0m. Under Unix [5XGAP[0m can access the
  original  contents  of a gzipped file without uncompressing it as a whole by
  using  a pipe. On 32-bit systems this might fail in extreme cirumstances. In
  that  case  [5XGAP[0m  has  to  be  restarted. This functionality is [13Xnot[0m currently
  available under Windows (or for any other compression type).
  
  It  should  be  possible  to use [5XSmallsemi[0m under Windows after unzipping all
  data  files. (These are located in the directory [11Xdata[0m and its subdirectories
  and have the file extension [11X.gz[0m.)
  
  
  [1X1.2 Installation and Setup[0X
  
  
  [1X1.2-1 Download and Extract [5XSmallsemi[1X[0X
  
  The installation follows standard [5XGAP[0m rules as outlined in the following two
  steps; see [14X'Reference: Installing a GAP Package'[0m for further details.
  
  (1)   Download    one    of    the    archives    [11Xsmallsemi0r6p2.tar.gz[0m   or
        [11Xsmallsemi0r6p2.tar.bz2[0m from
        [7Xhttp://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jamesm/smallsemi/index.html[0m
  
  (2)   Move  the  archive inside a [11Xpkg[0m directory. This can be either the main
        [11Xpkg[0m directory in your [5XGAP[0m installation or your personal [11Xpkg[0m directory.
  
  (3)   Complete  the  installation by unpacking the archive, e.g. under Linux
        type  [11Xtar  -xzf  smallsemi0r6p2.tar.gz[0m  at  the prompt for the gzipped
        [11Xtar[0m-archive.  A  subdirectory [11Xsmallsemi[0m will be created inside the [11Xpkg[0m
        directory.
  
  
  [1X1.2-2 Contents[0X
  
  In  the  subdirectory  [11Xsmallsemi[0m  you  should  find  the following files and
  folders:
  
        [11XCHANGELOG[0m       documents changes to previous versions     
        [11Xdata[0m            contains the data files for semigroups

  General  information  about  the  files  in  a  [5XGAP[0m  package can be found in
  [14X'Extending: The Files of a GAP Package'[0m.
  
  
  [1X1.2-3 Loading[0X
  
  To  use  the package, start a [5XGAP[0m session and type [10XLoadPackage("smallsemi");[0m
  at the [5XGAP[0m prompt. You should see the following:
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X

  You  might  want  to  start  [5XGAP[0m  with  a  specified  amount  of memory; see
  Subsection [14X1.2-4[0m.
  
  
  [1X1.2-4 Memory Issues[0X
  
  As  mentioned  in  Subsection  [14X1.1-2[0m,  working with [5Xsmallsemi [0m can be memory
  expensive. It is therefore necessary to either:
  
  (1)   start  [5XGAP[0m  with  1 GB of memory (if possible), for example, by typing
        [10Xgap -m 1g[0m; or
  
  (2)   extend  the  amount  memory  used  by typing [10Xreturn;[0m in the break-loop
        whenever [5XGAP[0m runs out of memory. For example,
  
        [4X------------------------  Example  ------------------------[0X
          [4Xgap> s:=SmallSemigroup(8, 183244314);[0X

  [1X1.2-5 Testing[0X
  
  You  should verify the success of the installation by running the test file.
  This  is  done  by  the following command and should return a similar output
  (the  number  of  [10XGAP4stones[0m  might  differ  depending  on the speed of your
  machine):
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4Xgap> ReadPackage( "smallsemi", "tst/testall.g" );[0X
    [4X+ small.tst 0.6.2[0X

    [4Xgap>[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  (The  output produced by running the tests from the file 'properties.tst' is
  due to a bug in GAP 4.4.12 which will be fixed in the next version.)
  
  
  [1X1.2-6 Customizing[0X
  
  If  you  are  using  [5XSmallsemi[0m  regularly  you might want to put the command
  [10XLoadPackage("smallsemi");[0m  into your [11X.gaprc[0m file; see [14X'Reference: The .gaprc
  file'[0m.  Another  option  is  to save a workspace after loading [5XSmallsemi[0m and
  executing the following commands
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4Xgap> SmallSemigroup(7,1);; MOREDATA2TO8;;[0X
    [4X#I  smallsemi: loading data for semigroups of size 7.[0X
    [4X#I  smallsemi: loading data for semigroup properties. Please be patient.[0X
    [4Xgap> SaveWorkspace( "<filename for the workspace>" );[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  Doing  this  will  mean  that  it is not necessary to load the data from the
  library  every  time you start a new [5XGAP[0m session; see [14X'Reference: Saving and
  Loading a Workspace'[0m.
  
  The  size  of  the file containing the saved workspace will be around 76 MB.
  Loading  this  workspace is much quicker than starting a new [5XGAP[0m session and
  all  the data for semigroups of orders 1 through 7 is immediately available.
  (If  you  are  working  under  Unix  you  can  make use of the functionality
  mentioned  in  Subsection  [14X1.1-3[0m  and  compress  the  workspace with gzip to
  roughly 10 MB.)
